# Event KeyCodes

This project demonstrates how to capture keyboard events in the browser using JavaScript and display relevant key information dynamically. Itâ€™s a simple interactive web app that updates in real-time to show which key the user presses, along with its `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` values.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Captures keyboard events (`keydown`)
- Displays:
  - The key that was pressed
  - The key code (deprecated but still informative)
  - The physical key code (`e.code`)
- Responsive and styled using modern CSS
- Smooth animations for better user experience

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup structure
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Event handling and DOM manipulation

## ðŸš€ How it Works

1. User loads the webpage.
2. A message prompts: _"Press the key and watch magic"_.
3. On pressing any key, the display updates with a table containing:
   - The actual key (e.g., `A`, `Enter`, `Space`)
   - Its key code (e.g., `65` for `A`)
   - Its code (e.g., `KeyA`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that helps understand event listeners and real-time DOM updates. It's particularly useful for learners exploring keyboard events and event object properties in JavaScript.

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The layout adapts well to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, with adjustments in table spacing and card margins.
